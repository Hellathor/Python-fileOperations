This is a Program that calculates for the values of Iterations in finding the roots or Solution to Algebraic
and Transcendental equations. 
	The program:
		* Gets an equation from the user
		* Uses either Bisection method or False Position method
		* Picks two values for a and b automatically or user gets to enter the values
		* Ends the iterations automatically or at the end of user specified number
		* Gives out the resulting iterations in the form of a table

I wrote this program as a kind of personal project. I reluctantly thougth of writting a code to solve for 
the (boring) numerous iterations in finding the root of an equation, while I was in class (in my second year), 
using the Bisection Method. I later started coding it (since the steps were already computational). I was able 
to get the program that works fine after a few weeks. I never got to utilise it for my Course (Numerical Analysis) 
as I aimed, since we already covered the topic (Bisection Method) before its completion 
(some kind of delay though; 'got no laptop, had to use my Department's Computer Lab during school hours on weekdays). 
Abandoned the code since that time (August, 2018). But I got satisfied anyways - it works! 
The code as at then was limited to the simple features:
	User,
	--> Enters an equation
	--> Enter a set of (2) values (for a and b) if there is or select automatically
	--> Gets a set of numbers of iterations n, as included in the code (not flexible and accurate) 
...but this was later improved upon subsequently this year which enabled it to permit the features listed above.
