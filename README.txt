FILE OPERATIONS
This is a simple file operation created with Python. You can use it to perform 
the following segmented operations:

	* Creating a new file
	* Openning of an existing file
	* Deleting an existing file

The sub operations of the above are:
	* Adding content to an existing file
	* Editing an existing file
	* Viewiing the content of a file

NOTE: YOUR FILE WILL BE LOCATED IN A FOLDER NAMED files IN THE SAME DIRECTORY 
      WITH THIS FILE (OR THE PYTHON FILE) 
	 ALL OPERATIONS INVOLVED ARE LIMITED TO .txt (NOTEPAD) FILES
	 YOU CAN EDIT IT TO YOUR CHOICE OF FILE
